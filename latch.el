;;; latch.el --- promises and latches for Elisp

;; This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.

;;; Commentary:

;; This code (ab)uses `accept-process-output' and processes to provide
;; asynchronous blocking, allowing other functions to run before the
;; current execution context completes. All blocking will freeze the
;; Emacs display, but timers and I/O will continue to run.

;; Three classes are provided, each building on the last: latch,
;; one-time-latch, and promise. See `make-latch',
;; `make-one-time-latch', and `make-promise'.

;; Each latch has an associated process, which doesn't get garbage
;; collected, so they need to be destroyed when no longer in
;; use. One-time-latches destroy themselves automatically after one
;; use. Use `destroy-all-latches' to clean up during debugging.

;; Methods:

;; (`wait' latch &optional timeout)
;;    Blocking wait on a latch for a `notify'.
;; (`notify' latch &optional value)
;;    Resume all executation contexts waiting on the latch.
;; (`destroy' latch)
;;    Free resources consumed by the latch.

;; (`deliver' promise value)
;;    Deliver a value to a promise. Only happens once per promise.
;; (`retrieve' promise)
;;    Retrieve a value from a promise, blocking if necessary.

;; A promise is basically a one-time-latch whose result can be
;; retrieved more than once (i.e. cached).

;; For example, to implement your own `sleep-for' function.

;; (defun my-sleep-for (n)
;;   (let ((latch (make-one-time-latch)))
;;     (run-at-time n nil #'notify latch t)
;;     (wait latch)))

;; Or turn an asynchronous function (requires a callback to receive
;; the result) into a synchronous one (returns the result). Note the
;; important use of `lexical-let'!

;; (lexical-let ((latch (make-one-time-latch)))
;;   (skewer-eval "Math.pow(3.1, 2.1)" (apply-partially #'notify latch))
;;   (wait latch))

;; The same thing using a promise,

;; (lexical-let ((promise (make-promise)))
;;   (skewer-eval "Math.pow(3.1, 2.1)" (apply-partially #'deliver promise))
;;   (retrieve promise))

;; Futures:

;; A `future' macro is provided for educational purposes, but it is
;; completely useless in Emacs' single-threaded environment. Don't use
;; it.

;; Notice:

;; Due to a segfault bug (Debian #698096) in Emacs 24.2, this code
;; uses heavier PTY connections instead of pipes.
